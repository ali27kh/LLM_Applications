# 📊 LangChain: Multi-Agent AI Systems for Text Processing & Knowledge Retrieval (using LLM)

## 📖 Overview
This collection of projects showcases **LangChain-powered AI systems** for advanced text processing and multi-source question answering. It includes: (1) an **evaluation framework** for QA systems with metrics like ROUGE and semantic similarity, (2) a **multi-prompt router** directing queries to specialized experts (Medicine, Psychology, Math, Tunisian History), (3) a **sequential text processing pipeline** for language detection, translation, and summarization/paraphrasing, and (4) a **multi-source AI agent** integrating PDF-based retrieval (FAISS), expert agents (Business, Finance, HR), and Wikipedia for comprehensive answers.

## ✅ Features
- 🔄 Dynamic routing and sequential processing for specialized tasks
- 📝 Memory retention and semantic search for contextual responses
- 📊 Rich evaluation metrics and multi-tool integration for diverse queries
